BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
MASTER_KEY=your_32_byte_hex_encryption_key
RPC_URL=your_bnb_chain_rpc_url
ADMIN_TELEGRAM_ID=your_telegram_user_id
PROXY=host:port:username:password  # Optional
```

4. Generate a master key for encryption:
```python
import secrets
print(secrets.token_hex(32))
```

5. Run the bot:
```bash
cd bot
python main.py
```

## Usage

### Registration

1. Start the bot with `/start`
2. Enter your invite code (10-character alphanumeric code)
3. Enter your Balance spot address from your [predict.fun profile](https://app.opinion.trade?code=BJea79)
   - ⚠️ **Important**: Must be the wallet address for which the API key was obtained
4. Enter your private key
   - ⚠️ **Important**: Must correspond to the wallet address from step 3
5. Enter your PredictDotFun Labs API key
   - ⚠️ **Important**: Must be the API key obtained for the wallet from step 3

All data is encrypted and stored securely. The bot validates:
- Uniqueness of wallet address, private key, and API key
- API connection at the end of registration (using `get_my_orders`)
- If connection test fails, registration is aborted and you'll need to restart with `/start`

The invite code is validated and used atomically at the end of registration only if all checks pass.

```

## Architecture

The bot uses a modular router-based architecture:

- **Routers**: Separate routers for different features (`start_router`, `market_router`)
- **Async Database**: All database operations use `aiosqlite` for non-blocking I/O
- **Background Tasks**: Order synchronization runs as an independent async task
- **Dialogs**: Complex multi-step interactions use `aiogram-dialog` for better UX
- **Middleware**: Global anti-spam protection for all messages and callbacks
- **API Wrapper**: Centralized async wrapper for PredictDotFun API calls

## Security

- **AES-GCM Encryption**: Industry-standard encryption for sensitive data
- **Local Storage**: All data stored locally on your server
- **No Third-Party Sharing**: Your credentials are never shared with third parties
- **Encrypted Database**: SQLite database contains only encrypted data
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking I/O prevents performance issues
- **Invite System**: Access control through invite codes

## Configuration

The bot supports the following environment variables:

- `BOT_TOKEN`: Telegram bot token (required)
- `MASTER_KEY`: 32-byte hex key for encryption (required)
- `RPC_URL`: BNB Chain RPC endpoint (required)
- `ADMIN_TELEGRAM_ID`: Telegram user ID for admin commands (required for invite management)
- `PROXY`: Proxy configuration in format `host:port:username:password` (optional)

## Commands

### User Commands
- `/start` - Register and set up your account (requires invite code)
- `/make_market` - Start placing a limit order
- `/orders` - View, search, and manage your orders
- `/help` - View comprehensive bot instructions (available in English, Russian, and Chinese)
- `/support` - Contact administrator with questions or issues (supports text and photos)

### Admin Commands
- `/get_db` - Export user database (admin only)
- `/get_invites` - Get 10 unused invite codes with statistics (admin only)
- `/delete_user` - Delete a user from the database (admin only)

## Automatic Order Synchronization

The bot automatically synchronizes your orders every 60 seconds:

### How it works:
1. **Status Check**: For each pending order, checks status via API
   - If order is finished: updates database to 'finished', sends notification with order details (price, market link)
   - If order is canceled: updates database to 'canceled', skips processing silently (no notification)
   - If status check fails: continues with normal processing (graceful degradation)

2. **Price Monitoring**: Monitors market prices and maintains a constant offset (in ticks) between the current market price and your order's target price

3. **Smart Updates**: Only moves orders when the price change exceeds the reposition threshold (default 0.5 cents)

4. **Batch Operations**: Efficiently cancels and places orders in batches per user

5. **Notifications**: You'll receive notifications when:
   - Market price changes and orders need to be moved (before repositioning)
   - Orders are successfully updated with new prices (after repositioning)
   - Orders are filled (with order details and market link)
   - Placement errors occur (with detailed error messages)

### Features:
- **Efficiency**: Skips repositioning when change < threshold (saves API calls and gas fees)
- **Reliability**: Only places new orders after successfully canceling old ones
- **Safety**: Validates all operations via API response codes (errno == 0)
- **User Awareness**: Detailed notifications for all important events
- **Performance**: Logs execution time for each user's processing

## Dependencies

- `aiogram==3.23.0` - Telegram Bot API framework
- `aiogram-dialog==2.4.0` - Dialog system for complex interactions
- `aiosqlite==0.22.0` - Async SQLite driver for non-blocking database operations
- `opinion-clob-sdk==0.4.3` - predict.fun SDK for market interactions
- `cryptography==46.0.3` - AES-GCM encryption
- `pydantic==2.12.5` - Settings management
- `pydantic-settings==2.12.0` - Environment variable settings
- `python-dotenv==1.2.1` - Environment variable loading

## Technical Details

### Async Architecture
- All database operations use `aiosqlite` for true async I/O
- API calls are wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread()` to prevent blocking
- Background tasks run independently without blocking the main event loop
- PredictDotFun API wrapper provides async interface for synchronous SDK

### Order Synchronization Algorithm
1. Retrieves all users from the database
2. For each user:
   - Gets active orders from the database
   - For each order:
     - **Status Check**: Checks order status via API
       - If filled: updates DB, sends notification, skips processing
       - If cancelled: updates DB, skips processing
     - Fetches current market price (best_bid for BUY, best_ask for SELL)
     - Calculates new target price using saved `offset_ticks`
     - Calculates price change in cents
     - If price change ≥ `reposition_threshold_cents`, adds to cancellation/placement lists
     - Sends price change notification (only if order will be repositioned)
   - Cancels old orders in batch (validates via errno == 0)
   - Places new orders in batch (only if all old orders were cancelled)
   - Updates database with new order parameters (only for successful placements)
   - Sends order update notification (for successful placements)
   - Sends error notification (for failed placements)

### Invite System
- Invites are stored in `invites` table with fields: id, invite (unique), telegram_id, created_at, used_at
- Invite codes are 10-character alphanumeric strings
- Invites are validated before registration and used atomically at the end
- Admin can generate invites via `/get_invites` command
- System automatically creates new invites if needed

### Database Schema
- **users**: Encrypted user credentials (wallet, private key, API key)
  - `telegram_id` (PRIMARY KEY): User's Telegram ID
  - All sensitive data encrypted with AES-GCM
  - Unique constraints on wallet address, private key, and API key
- **orders**: Order information (order_id, market_id, prices, amounts, status, etc.)
  - Status values: `pending`, `finished`, `canceled` (aligned with API terminology)
  - Default status: `pending`
  - Migration function updates old statuses automatically
- **invites**: Invite codes and usage tracking
